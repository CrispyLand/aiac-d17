 * were not known when this class was compiled.
 *
 * @param parameters the tool's JSON Schema, still as the nested map the protocol delivered.
 *                   Deliberately not a string and deliberately not modelled as Java types: it is
 *                   somebody else's schema, this application has no business understanding it, and
 *                   the only code that needs to is the one class allowed to touch JSON. Passing the
 *                   map keeps that true — {@link GroqLlmClient} converts it, nobody else parses it

     * are counted too, and so the tokenizer sees the same run of text the provider will.
