 * The model asking for a tool to be run.
 *
 * @param id        the provider's handle for this call. Opaque and load-bearing: the result has to
 *                  be sent back quoting it, or a reply to one of two parallel calls is matched to
 *                  the wrong question
 * @param arguments what the model filled the schema in with, already parsed. Arrives from the
 *                  provider as a JSON <em>string</em> and is turned into this map by
 *                  {@link GroqLlmClient}, so that the layer which executes tools never has to
 *                  parse anything — and so that a model emitting malformed JSON is caught at the
 *                  boundary rather than three classes further in
