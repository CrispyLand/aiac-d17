/**
 * What the next call is about to cost, measured against the model's context window.
 * <p>
 * The window is not "how long the prompt may be" — it has to hold the prompt <em>and</em>
 * the answer. Reserving {@code max_completion_tokens} up front is the whole point: a prompt
 * that fits with one token to spare leaves the model no room to reply, and the provider
 * rejects the call rather than truncating the input.
 * <p>
 * The breakdown is one line per memory layer, plus the things that are not memory at all:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code systemTokens} — the instruction, re-sent every single call</li>
 *   <li>{@code invariantTokens} — the standing rules. Counted apart from memory for the same
 *       reason the profile is, and more so: an invariant is not something the agent inferred, it
 *       is something a person declared, and it stays in the prompt until they retire it. The
 *       figure is worth seeing precisely because it is the one line here that a cost-conscious
 *       reader might want to cut and must not</li>
 *   <li>{@code profileTokens} — the user's declared preferences; not memory, and deliberately
 *       counted apart from it, because a profile is what somebody asked for rather than
 *       something the agent worked out, and the two fail in different ways</li>
 *   <li>{@code longTermTokens} — what is known about the user; survives this conversation</li>
 *   <li>{@code workingTokens} — the current task's block; dies with the task</li>
 *   <li>{@code taskTokens} — where that task has got to. Counted inside the memory total, unlike
 *       the profile: this one is the agent's own inference about the conversation, so "does it
 *       change any answer, and is that worth what it costs every turn" is a fair question to ask
 *       of it — which is exactly the question the memory total exists to make askable</li>
 *   <li>{@code summaryTokens} — short-term, compressed: the stand-in for turns already folded away</li>
 *   <li>{@code historyTokens} — short-term, verbatim: the part that grows turn by turn</li>
 *   <li>{@code inputTokens} — the new message, plus the request's framing overhead</li>
 *   <li>{@code toolTokens} — the MCP tool schemas offered on this call. The one line here that is
 *       not in the message array at all: it rides in the request's {@code tools} field, and it is
 *       the only line whose size is decided by somebody else's server. Measured at 149 tokens for
 *       a two-tool server and 673 for a four-tool one, re-sent on every request of the turn</li>
 *   <li>{@code overheadTokens} — the provider's own chat template, learned by observation</li>
 * </ul>
 * Splitting the memory lines by layer rather than reporting one "context" figure is what makes
 * the model's behaviour attributable: when an answer recalls something, the layer it came from
 * has a price attached to it, and a layer that costs tokens every turn and never changes an
 * answer is visibly not paying for itself.
 *
 * @param droppedMessages how many oldest messages the trim policy removed to make the call fit —
 *                        an overflow rescue, not a plan
 * @param replacedTokens  what the folded-away messages would still be adding to this prompt,
 *                        which is the only honest baseline to measure the saving against
 * @param calibrated      false until this model has been seen once and the overhead is real
