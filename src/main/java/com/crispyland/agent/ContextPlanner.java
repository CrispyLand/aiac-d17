/**
 * Turns the memory layers into the next request, and prices each layer before sending it.
 * <p>
 * This is the only place that knows how a prompt is laid out, so the ordering decisions live
 * here. Layers are emitted most-durable first and the user's new message last, which matters
 * because attention is not uniform: the tail of a prompt carries disproportionate weight, so the
 * question itself goes last and the standing context goes above it. The summary sits directly
 * before the verbatim tail so the transcript still reads in chronological order — what has been
 * forgotten, then what is still remembered word for word.
 * <p>
 * Each layer is a separate {@code system} message rather than being glued onto the system
 * prompt. The system prompt is an instruction the user edits; recalled memory is state. Labelling
 * them separately is what stops the model from reading last week's notes as a fresh directive,
 * and it is what lets the budget attribute tokens to a layer instead of to "context".
 * <p>
 * The profile block breaks the most-durable-first rule on purpose, and it is the one exception.
 * Everything else is ordered by age because later is newer and newer should win; a profile is
 * ordered by <em>authority</em>, because it is not something the agent learned at any point in
 * time — it is a standing instruction from the person being answered. It therefore sits directly
 * under the system prompt, above every remembered layer, and says in its own words that it
 * outranks them. Put it where its age suggests and a preference someone wrote down this morning
 * loses to one the extractor inferred from a throwaway remark last month.
 * <p>
 * Invariants are the same exception taken one step further, and so they sit one step higher —
 * directly under the system prompt, above even the profile. The ordering is the claim: a profile
 * says how the user would like to be answered, and an invariant says what may not be proposed at
 * all. When the two disagree the invariant has to win, and putting it above is the cheapest way
 * of saying so. It is also the only block here that is never the agent's own inference: nothing
 * in the extraction path can write one.
